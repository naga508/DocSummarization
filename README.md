# What's up Docs? â€“ DrivenData Competition

This repository contains code and experiments for the [What's up Docs?](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/297/whats-up-docs/) competition hosted on DrivenData.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal of this competition is to automatically classify scientific documents into predefined categories.  
We aim to explore both classical machine learning (TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) and modern deep learning approaches (BERT, SciBERT, DeBERTa, etc.) for multi-class / multi-label text classification.
